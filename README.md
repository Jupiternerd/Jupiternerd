# I would be majoring in art if it actually paid well.

💬  I can technically draw, code, write, model (not the flashy cool kind), anything you want- Always new to learning new things, as long as it's not boring. Comfortable with Js and Py. Clip Studio Paint and Procreate for art. Blender for 3D renders. Discord for main communications. Mezes Neo 99 on 24/7.
