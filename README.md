# I should have majored in art.

💬 |  x I can draw, code, write (stretching it), model (not the flashy cool kind), anything you want- Self Taught everything. Always fun to learn new things, as long as it's not boring. Comfortable with **Js** and **Py**🐍. **Clip Studio Pain**t and **Procreate** for art. **Blender** for 3D renders. **Discord** for main communications. **Mezes Neo 99** on 24/7.

🍊 |  x Currently learning **Blender**.
